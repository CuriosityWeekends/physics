**__MathLab/HS Physics__**

**Aim** - We *Ishan, Hadin and Mehran* are trying to SIMULATE and understand the true concepts of math & Physics.
      We do this by using actuall formulas or we actually Rediscover them through our tinkering

**What?** -  We have already done a few simulations like
        __*Gravity*__ (Making a Ball/Cube bonce around In 3D*Blender*)
        __*Solar System*__ (Making a Spheres with given mass u and other info revolve around each other like an actual **Solar System**)
        __*Directly Figuring out the The pos of object(gravity)*__ Instead of individually simulating the next scene we directly found the pos of the object by rediscovering one of the Equations of motion
        __*Projectile landing*__ find the posision an object lands with a given u and theta(took about 4 hours '2025/6/29')
